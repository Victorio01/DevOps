# My experience!

Actually these last days have been wonderful in terms of learning, despite my bad programming habits, I learned many things based on trial and error, but it was interesting, the truth is that I fell in love with the way this kind of work works and its dynamics, unfortunately I'm not going to finish this project on time, but I'm going to continue developing it in my own time, one way or another, I'm going to continue learning:')
